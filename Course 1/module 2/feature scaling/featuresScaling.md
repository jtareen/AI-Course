### Notes on Feature Scaling

**Introduction to Feature Scaling:**
- **Purpose:** Feature scaling helps gradient descent algorithms run much faster by ensuring all features contribute equally to the model's performance.
- **Example:** Predicting house prices using two features:
  - \( x_1 \): Size of the house (300 to 2000 square feet)
  - \( x_2 \): Number of bedrooms (0 to 5 bedrooms)

**Impact of Feature Range on Parameters:**
- Larger feature ranges often require smaller parameter values.
- Smaller feature ranges may require larger parameter values.

**Example with Parameters:**
1. **Parameters \( w_1 = 50 \), \( w_2 = 0.1 \), \( b = 50 \)**
   - Predicted price: \( 50 \times 2000 + 0.1 \times 5 + 50 = 100,000 + 0.5 + 50 \) (far from actual $500,000)
2. **Parameters \( w_1 = 0.1 \), \( w_2 = 50 \), \( b = 50 \)**
   - Predicted price: \( 0.1 \times 2000 + 50 \times 5 + 50 = 200 + 250 + 50 = 500,000 \) (matches actual $500,000)

**Impact on Gradient Descent:**
- **Cost Function Contours:**
  - Without scaling, contours are elongated ellipses, causing gradient descent to oscillate and converge slowly.
  - With scaling, contours become more circular, allowing faster convergence.
  
**Visual Representation:**
- Scatter plot with unscaled features shows a wide range of values on the x-axis compared to the y-axis.
- Contour plots of the cost function:
  - Unscaled: Narrow range for \( w_1 \) and large range for \( w_2 \), creating tall, skinny ellipses.
  - Scaled: Both axes take comparable ranges, creating more circular contours.

**Benefits of Feature Scaling:**
- **Improved Gradient Descent Efficiency:** Rescaling features so they take on similar ranges improves gradient descent's efficiency.
- **Direct Path to Global Minimum:** Transformed data results in more uniform contour plots, facilitating a more direct path to the global minimum.

**How to Perform Feature Scaling:**
- Methods to be discussed in a subsequent video. 

### Summary:
Feature scaling is crucial for optimizing the performance of gradient descent by making features comparable in range, which transforms the cost function's contours into more circular shapes and speeds up convergence.
